          Guitar chord charts are simple visual maps that show you where to place your fingers on the fretboard.
          At first, they might look confusing, but once you understand a few basic symbols, they become easy to read.
          This page will walk you through each part of a chord chart step by step, so you can confidently learn new
          chords and start playing real music.

          A chord chart is drawn as if you are looking straight at the guitar’s fretboard.
          The vertical lines represent the strings, and the horizontal lines represent the frets.
          The string on the left is the thick low E string, and the string on the right is the thin high E string.

          The six vertical lines in a chord chart represent the six strings of the guitar.
          From left to right, they are the low E, A, D, G, B, and high E strings.
          Even though the high E string is also called E, it is thinner and higher in pitch.

          The horizontal lines represent the frets.
          The top line is usually the nut of the guitar, and the spaces between the lines are the frets.
          When you place your finger on a fret, press just behind the metal bar, not directly on top of it.

          The filled-in dots show where to place your fingers.
          Each dot tells you which string to press and on which fret.
          If more than one dot appears on the same fret, it means you are pressing multiple strings at once.

          Symbols above the chord chart tell you how each string should be played.
          An “O” means play the string open without pressing it down.
          An “X” means do not play that string at all.

          When you put all of these elements together, a chord chart gives you everything you need to know
          to play a chord: which strings to play, where to place your fingers, and which strings to avoid.
          With a little practice, reading chord charts becomes second nature.
